In this section, you’ll set up your personal profile’s basic settings including your Users, Personal Logo, Location Details, Currency, and Time Zone.

Online Payments
"""""""""""""""

When you open an account, this is one of the most important steps you’ll need to take towards getting paid. Here you can choose your payment type, payment gateway, and accepted credit cards. Please note that you must first set up an account with a payment gateway to integrate. We integrate with over 30+ payment gateways: https://www.ezinvoice.lu/partners/

Product Library
"""""""""""""""

The product library has the ability to store all off the various products you offer to clients, along with cost and a notes section per product. You can add as many products as you’d like, and they will all appear in the ‘item’ dropdown when you create an invoice, saving you time and hassle. Auto-fill and Auto-update settings are available for further ease of use when working with products frequently.

We offer a variety of e-mail notification settings which include whether or not you’d like a notification when an invoice is sent, paid, viewed, or approved.
